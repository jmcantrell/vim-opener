INTRODUCTION                                          *opener* *opener.vim*

The opener plugin allows you to open files, URLs, or anything recognizable to
your system in the appropriate viewer.

COMMANDS                                              *opener-commands*

:Opener [location]    Open location with the appropriate handler on your
                      system. If location is not given, Use whatever is
                      visually selected. Multiple locations can be selected at
                      a time.

MAPPINGS                                              *opener-mappings*

gO                    Invoke :OpenLocation with the visually selected text, or
                      the value of <cfile>, if no text is selected.

This mapping can be overriden:

    nmap <leader>o <plug>Opener
    vmap <leader>o <plug>Opener
